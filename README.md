Eligibility


Our Services are intended for individuals over the age of 13. If you are under 13, you must have parental or legal guardian consent to create and maintain an account. By using our Services, you affirm that you meet these requirements.


Account Registration

You may create an account on BestBefore by providing an email and password. By doing so you agree to provide accurate and complete information. Accounts created through automated means or "bots" are not permitted and will be terminated.


Account Security

You are individually responsible for all data you store on the service and for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.

You may receive notifications through email by signing up through email, and/or by push notification if you have required permissions enabled on your device.

Inactivity is determined based on your lack of access or usage of the Services.
